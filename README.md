# Electrical Network Theory

This project is a **basic Python framework for electrical network analysis**, 
with a clear distinction between:

- **steady-state operation**, and  
- **transient behaviour** (e.g. switching and energisation phenomena).

## Scope

At its current stage, the project supports:

- modelling of electrical networks using nodes and branches,
- common passive components and voltage sources,
- formulation of network equations using **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)**,
- steady-state calculations,
- time-domain simulation for transient effects.

Examples illustrating the use of the package can be found in `/examples`.
